# Skin-Disorder-Prediction-ML

**Business Case for this Project**
<br>
Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict the various classes of skin diseases for Suggestions to the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at the earliest


**Short Description**
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting various classes of skin disorders to aid early diagnosis. The project explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, with the Random Forest model achieving an accuracy of 95% for practical applications in dermatology.
